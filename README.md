Here you will find the project that I made to test my knowledge and implement something that I learned.
Each project folder will have a word document in it.
The document will contain mainly:
- What I wanted to create.
- How I approached the project.
- My problems along the way and if I fixed them.
- Also time used to finish the project.
#Please note that some projects were completed over non-consecutive days
